# Humidity-and-Temperature-Sensor-for-Indoor-Environment-Monitoring-using-STM32F103C8T6
This project demonstrates a real-time indoor environmental monitoring system using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller and DHT11 sensor. The system processes sensor data and displays it on an OLED screen, providing accurate temperature and humidity readings.
